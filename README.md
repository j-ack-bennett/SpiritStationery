# Spirit Stationery

This was a one day group project created during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy.

We wanted to create a really simple and boring website, so boring infact that it was about office stationery.
The concept of this website was to enter your name in to find your "Spirit Stationery", almost like finding your "Spirit Animal".

The project incorporated the use of a fullstack lineup including:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js (SQL)](https://knexjs.org/)
